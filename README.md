[Full Project Report](docs/Report.pdf)

This project focuses on applying machine learning techniques to analyze binary phases using OPXRD (Operando X-ray Diffraction) data.

## Project Structure

- `docs/`: Contains detailed documentation including analysis summaries, data explanations, project plans, and implementation details.
- `data/`: Raw data files.
- `opxrd_data/`: Processed OPXRD data.
- `src/`: Source code for data processing, model training, and analysis.
- `results/`: Stores evaluation results and metrics.
- `plots/`: Contains generated plots and visualizations.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists project dependencies.

## Setup

To set up the project, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:
